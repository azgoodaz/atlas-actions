# Join to Create Voice Channels

A script that makes 1 voice channel the ability to create 1 temporary channel per user at a time.

## Usage

1) Replace logID with your channel where you want output sent.
2) Add the main booster role ID that Discord gives users automatically.
3) Add in the ID's of your custom colors that boosters can optional select/use.
4) It runs on an interval so that each month when Boost runs out it will remove any custom colors if the user doesn't have the main Nitro Booster role.
5) Press 'Save' and wait until the beginning of the month for the bot to remove roles.
