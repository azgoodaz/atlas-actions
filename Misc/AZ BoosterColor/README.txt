# Booster Colors

A Nitro Booster action which removes custom colors from users when users stop boosting.

## Usage

1) Replace logID with your channel where you want output sent.
2) Add in the custom colors
3) It runs on an interval so that each month when Boost runs out it will remove any custom colors if the user doesn't have the main Nitro Booster role.
