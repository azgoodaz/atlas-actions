# Booster Colors

A Nitro Booster action which removes custom colors from users when users stop boosting.

## Usage

1) Replace logID with your channel where you want output sent.
2) Add the main booster role ID that Discord gives users automatically.
3) Add in the ID's of your custom colors that boosters can optional select/use.
4) It runs on an interval so that each month when Boost runs out it will remove any custom colors if the user doesn't have the main Nitro Booster role.
5) Press 'Save' and wait until the beginning of the month for the bot to remove roles.
